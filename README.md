## What is minipp2buddy?

minipp2buddy is an web based application with similar functions from original

Currently am building the application base by myself and after few releases where 
some kind of base has been build am welcoming all who can contribute code to project.
Also if you want to leave ideas what you would like to see in the application 
leave write an 'issue' or contact me through the game or kalassa.net forum

## Current Status
Core starts to be in some sort of order for playlog processing and already used
on production site for [Finnish Team League](http://teamkn.net/liiga_laskuri/) 
site. Site custom front-end and wont be included into main project.

Currently working on "buddyconnect" which can receiver information through bash
script or through local php script run with php-cli. This is to ease linux hosts
and automate whole process with possibility to add processing as cronjob

Next steps, light weight sql library, sql database model and model objects for
tables.
